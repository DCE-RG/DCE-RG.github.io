            In this paper we propose and study a family of continuous wavelets on general domains, and a corresponding stochastic discretization that we call Monte Carlo wavelets. 
            First, using tools from the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and associated integral operators, we define a family of continuous wavelets by spectral calculus. 
            Then, we propose a stochastic discretization based on Monte Carlo estimates of integral operators. 
            Using concentration of measure results, we establish the convergence of such a discretization and derive convergence rates under natural regularity assumptions.

            History matching is a type of calibration, that attempts to find input parameters values to achieve the consistency between observations and computer model representation.
            History matching is most effective when it is performed in waves, i.e. refocussing steps (Williamson et al., 2017). 
            At each wave a new ensemble is obtained within the current Not Ruled Out Yet space (NROY), the emulator is updated and the procedure of cutting down the input space is performed again. </br> 
            </br> 
            Generating design for each wave is a challenging problem due to the unusual shapes of NROY space. 
            A number of approaches (Williamson and Vernon, 2013; Gong et al., 2016, Andrianakis et al., 2017) are focused on obtaining space-filling design over the NROY space. 
            In this talk we present a new decision-theoretic method for a design problem for iterative refocussing. 
            We employ a Bayesian experimental design and specify a loss function that compares a volume of NROY space obtained with an updated emulator to the volume of `true' NROY space obtained using a `perfect' emulator.  
            The derived expected loss function contains three independent and interpretable terms. 
            In this talk we compare the effect of proposed Bayesian Optimal Design to space-filling design approaches on the iterative refocussing performed on simulation studies. </br>
            </br> 
            We recognise that adopted Bayesian experimental design involves an expensive optimization problem. 
            Our proposed criterion also could be used to investigate and rank a range of candidate designs for iterative refocussing. 
            In this talk we demonstrate the mathematical justification provided by our Bayesian Design Criterion for each design candidate.

            With the incorporation of new data gathering methods in clinical research, it becomes fundamental for Survival Analysis techniques to be able to deal with high-dimensional or/and non-standard covariates.
            In this paper we introduce a general non-parametric independence test between right-censored survival times and covariates taking values on a general space $\mathcal{X}$. 
            We show our test statistic has a dual intepretation, first in terms of the supremum of a potentially infinite collection of weight-indexed log-rank tests, with weight functions belonging to a Reproducing kernel Hilbert space of functions (RKHS), and second, as the norm of the difference of the embeddings of certain ``depencency" measures into the RKHS, similarly to the well-know HSIC test-statistic. 
            We provide an easy-to-use test-statistic as well as an economic Wild-Bootstrap procedure and study asymptotic properties of the test, finding sufficient conditions to ensure our test is omnibus. 
            We perform extensive simulations demonstrating that our testing procedure performs, in general, better than competing approaches.

    <h4>&nbsp; &#8226; &nbsp; Topic: On the geometry of Stein variational gradient descent</h4>

                Bayesian inference problems require sampling or approximating high-dimensional probability distributions. 
                The focus of this paper is on the recently introduced Stein variational gradient descent methodology, a class of algorithms that rely on iterated steepest descent steps with respect to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space norm. 
                This construction leads to interacting particle systems, the mean-field limit of which is a gradient flow on the space of probability distributions equipped with a certain geometrical structure. 
                We leverage this viewpoint to shed some light on the convergence properties of the algorithm, in particular addressing the problem of choosing a suitable positive definite kernel function. 
                Our analysis leads us to considering certain nondifferentiable kernels with adjusted tails. 
                We demonstrate significant performs gains of these in various numerical experiments.
