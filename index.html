            In this paper we propose and study a family of continuous wavelets on general domains, and a corresponding stochastic discretization that we call Monte Carlo wavelets. 
            First, using tools from the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and associated integral operators, we define a family of continuous wavelets by spectral calculus. 
            Then, we propose a stochastic discretization based on Monte Carlo estimates of integral operators. 
            Using concentration of measure results, we establish the convergence of such a discretization and derive convergence rates under natural regularity assumptions.

            History matching is a type of calibration, that attempts to find input parameters values to achieve the consistency between observations and computer model representation.
            History matching is most effective when it is performed in waves, i.e. refocussing steps (Williamson et al., 2017). 
            At each wave a new ensemble is obtained within the current Not Ruled Out Yet space (NROY), the emulator is updated and the procedure of cutting down the input space is performed again. </br> 
            </br> 
            Generating design for each wave is a challenging problem due to the unusual shapes of NROY space. 
            A number of approaches (Williamson and Vernon, 2013; Gong et al., 2016, Andrianakis et al., 2017) are focused on obtaining space-filling design over the NROY space. 
            In this talk we present a new decision-theoretic method for a design problem for iterative refocussing. 
            We employ a Bayesian experimental design and specify a loss function that compares a volume of NROY space obtained with an updated emulator to the volume of `true' NROY space obtained using a `perfect' emulator.  
            The derived expected loss function contains three independent and interpretable terms. 
            In this talk we compare the effect of proposed Bayesian Optimal Design to space-filling design approaches on the iterative refocussing performed on simulation studies. </br>
            </br> 
            We recognise that adopted Bayesian experimental design involves an expensive optimization problem. 
            Our proposed criterion also could be used to investigate and rank a range of candidate designs for iterative refocussing. 
            In this talk we demonstrate the mathematical justification provided by our Bayesian Design Criterion for each design candidate.

            We generalize the state-of-the-art linked emulator for a system of two computer models under the squared exponential kernel to an integrated emulator for any feed-forward system of multiple computer models, under a variety of kernels (exponential, squared exponential, and two key Matérn kernels) that are essential in advanced applications. 
            The integrated emulator combines Gaussian process emulators of individual computer models, and predicts the global output of the system using a Gaussian distribution with explicit mean and variance. 
            By learning the system structure, our integrated emulator outperforms the composite emulator, which emulates the entire system using only global inputs and outputs. 
            Orders of magnitude prediction improvement can be achieved for moderate-size designs. 
            Furthermore, our analytic expressions allow a fast and efficient design algorithm that allocates different runs to individual computer models based on their heterogeneous functional complexity. 
            This design yields either significant computational gains or orders of magnitude reductions in prediction errors for moderate training sizes. We demonstrate the skills and benefits of the integrated emulator in a series of synthetic experiments and a feed-back coupled fire-detection satellite model.

            With the incorporation of new data gathering methods in clinical research, it becomes fundamental for Survival Analysis techniques to be able to deal with high-dimensional or/and non-standard covariates.
            In this paper we introduce a general non-parametric independence test between right-censored survival times and covariates taking values on a general space $\mathcal{X}$. 
            We show our test statistic has a dual intepretation, first in terms of the supremum of a potentially infinite collection of weight-indexed log-rank tests, with weight functions belonging to a Reproducing kernel Hilbert space of functions (RKHS), and second, as the norm of the difference of the embeddings of certain ``depencency" measures into the RKHS, similarly to the well-know HSIC test-statistic. 
            We provide an easy-to-use test-statistic as well as an economic Wild-Bootstrap procedure and study asymptotic properties of the test, finding sufficient conditions to ensure our test is omnibus. 
            We perform extensive simulations demonstrating that our testing procedure performs, in general, better than competing approaches.

            Expensive computer models often have high-dimensional spatial and/or temporal outputs, all of which we may be interested in predicting for unseen regions of parameter space, and in comparing to real-world observations (calibration/history matching). 
            When emulating such fields, it is common to either emulate each output individually, or project onto some low dimensional basis (e.g. SVD/PCA, rotations thereof). 
            Typically in a calibration exercise, we will require emulator evaluations for extremely large numbers of points  in the input space, with this problem becoming more computationally intensive as the output size increases. </br>
            </br> 
            We demonstrate several benefits of the basis approach to emulation of such fields, compared to emulating each output individually. 
            In particular, the efficiency that the basis structure allows, both when evaluating predictions at unseen inputs, and in calculating the calibration distance metric (implausibility). 
            We discuss how the basis should be chosen and explore examples from climate and engineering models.

            Bayesian inference problems require sampling or approximating high-dimensional probability distributions. 
            The focus of this paper is on the recently introduced Stein variational gradient descent methodology, a class of algorithms that rely on iterated steepest descent steps with respect to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space norm. 
            This construction leads to interacting particle systems, the mean-field limit of which is a gradient flow on the space of probability distributions equipped with a certain geometrical structure. 
            We leverage this viewpoint to shed some light on the convergence properties of the algorithm, in particular addressing the problem of choosing a suitable positive definite kernel function. 
            Our analysis leads us to considering certain nondifferentiable kernels with adjusted tails. 
            We demonstrate significant performs gains of these in various numerical experiments.

            Two-sample testing is the task of observing two collections of data samples and determining if they have the same distribution or not. 
            The use of kernel based two-sample tests has seen a lot of success in machine learning, for example in training GANs, due to its helpful computational and theoretical properties. 
            However the vast majority of work done so far in investigating this method has assumed the underlying data are random vectors. 
            We investigate the generalisation of these methods to the case of functional data, where one data point is a function observed at a discrete number of inputs. 
            Such data could still be considered as random vectors but we show how taking the functional view point opens up a large range of theoretical and practical insight. 
            We introduce a new class of kernels which result in consistent tests and discuss their implementation and theoretical properties.

            General Bayesian updating is a coherent framework for updating a prior belief distribution to a posterior, where the beliefs are over a parameter of interest that is related to observed data through a loss function, instead of directly corresponding to a likelihood function. 
            This is allows us to bypass the Bayesian machinery of modelling the true data-generating distribution which is becoming increasingly cumbersome as datasets grow in size and complexity. 
            The belief update is derived through decision theoretic arguments, and in particular requires coherence of beliefs.

            It is commonly accepted in statistics that the only way of dealing with uncertainty is through the mathematical tools characterising random phenomena. 
            However, it is often information, or rather the lack of it, that is the source of uncertainty. 
            Using probability theory in this case has known limitations such as the absence of non-informative priors in unbounded spaces. 
            The objective of this talk is to show how the measure-theoretic concept of outer measure can be used to model the lack of information about some parameters in a statistical model and to derive practical algorithms that complement the existing wealth of statistical techniques in a principled and yet intuitive way.

            We investigate the challenge of multi-output learning, where the goal is to learn a vector-valued function based on a supervised data set. 
            This includes a range of important problems in Machine Learning including multi-target regression, multi-class classification and multi-label classification. 
            We begin our analysis by introducing the self-bounding Lipschitz condition for multi-output loss functions, which interpolates continuously between a classical Lipschitz condition and a multi-dimensional analogue of a smoothness condition. 
            We then show that the self-bounding Lipschitz condition gives rise to optimistic bounds for multi-output learning, which are minimax optimal up to logarithmic factors. 
            The proof exploits local Rademacher complexity combined with a powerful minoration inequality due to Srebro, Sridharan and Tewari.

            Bayesian stability and sensitivity analyses have traditionally investigated the stability of posterior inferences to the subjective specification of the prior. 
            We extend this to consider the stability of inference to the selection of the likelihood function. 
            Rather than making the unrealistic assumption that the model is correctly specified for the process that generated the data, we assume that it is at best one of many possible approximations of the underlying process broadly representing the decision maker's (DM) beliefs. 
            We thus investigate the stability of posterior inferences to the arbitrary selection of one of these approximations. 
            We show that traditional Bayesian updating, minimising the Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) between the sample distribution of the observations and the model, is only stable to a very strict class of likelihood models. 
            On the other hand, generalised Bayesian inference (Bissiri et al., 2016) minimising the beta-divergence (betaD) is shown to be stable across interpretable neighbourhoods of likelihood models. 
            The result is that using Bayes' rule requires a DM to be unrealistically sure about the probability judgements made by their model while updating using the betaD is stable to reasonable perturbations from the chosen model. 
            We illustrate this for several regression and classification examples including a Bayesian on-line changepoint detection algorithm applied to air pollution data from the City of London.

            We introduce a framework for inference in general state-space hidden Markov models (HMMs) under likelihood misspecification. 
            In particular, we leverage the loss-theoretic perspective of generalized Bayesian inference (GBI) to define generalized filtering recursions in HMMs, that can tackle the problem of inference under model misspecification. 
            In doing so, we arrive at principled procedures for robust inference against observation contamination through the β-divergence. 
            Operationalizing the proposed framework is made possible via sequential Monte Carlo methods (SMC). The standard particle methods, and their associated convergence results, are readily generalized to the new setting.
